# avrispbdk
AVR In System Programmer ported from Arduino avrisp sketch

Starting with a "clean" copy of the avrisp sketch that accompanies the Arduino IDE, port it to straight C for use without Arduino.

This also gives a copy of the Arduino sketch that will remain static.

This is based on Arduino IDE 1.8.19.
The C version will be based on AVR GCC (version TBD)

An AVR hardware version will be included as well.
